### Problems

- Traditional online ordering applications don't account for restaurant inventory and might let customers order something that the restaurant is unable to make

- Restaurant owners and staff should be able to see when inventory is reaching critical levels and manually adjust inventory to account for waste 

- Customers should be able to view the menu and assemble an order

### Target Demographics

- Restaurant owners

  - Needs a reliable way to track inventory

  - Places an emphasis on customer service; doesn't want customers to be dissatisfied when an order cannot be fulfilled

  - Wants tools to allow delegation of duties to managers and workers
